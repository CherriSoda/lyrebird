# Lyrebird
Simple and powerful voice changer for Linux, written in GTK 3.

# Why?
I decided to write this as a tool for myself, partly for fun and partly
because I hate my own voice and since there was no decent Linux voice changers. The UI
is based *very* loosely off of Clownfish for Windows, and is very simple and easy to use.

# Features
- Built in effects for accurate male and female voices
- Manual pitch scale for finer adjustment
- A clean and easy to use GUI

# Requirements
- python-gobject
- pavucontrol
- sox
- PulseAudio
